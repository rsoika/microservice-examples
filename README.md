# microservice-examples
This is a collection of basic examples about how to implement a Microservice on different platforms. The examples can be used as templates for own projects on different environments:

 - [Hello-World Example Jakarta EE 9](./jakarta9/README.md)
 - [Hello-World Example Jakarta EE 8](./jakarta8/README.md)
 - [Hello-World Example Spring Boot 2.6.2](./springboot/README.md)

All microservices provide a simple ping and data endpoint to test JSON and XML data objects. The Jakarta Microservices are based on Eclipse Microprofile and can be started within a Docker container. The Spring Boot Microservice can be started by running the Java Main class BaseApplication.
